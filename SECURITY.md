# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The supported security scope for `roadmap` is the current default branch, `main`. Older commits, tags, branches, forks, demos, and generated artifacts are not actively supported unless the repository explicitly marks them as maintained.

Project summary: No GitHub description is currently set.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting or by opening a draft GitHub Security Advisory for `garethpaul/roadmap` when that option is available. If GitHub does not show a private reporting option for this repository, contact the repository owner through GitHub and avoid posting exploit details publicly until the issue can be assessed.

Do not open a public issue that includes exploit code, secrets, personal data, or detailed reproduction steps for an unpatched vulnerability.

## What to Include

Helpful reports include:

- the affected file, endpoint, permission, dependency, or workflow
- a concise impact statement explaining what an attacker could do
- reproduction steps using test data and accounts you control
- the branch, commit SHA, platform version, device, runtime, or dependency versions used
- logs, screenshots, or proof-of-concept snippets that demonstrate impact without exposing private data

## Project Security Posture

- This repository appears to be a public sample, documentation, or utility project. The active security scope is the code and documentation on the default branch.
- No active roadmap commitments are defined. Security reports are not roadmap
  commitments; they may clarify repository risk or disclosure handling, but
  they do not create product, project, owner, or delivery obligations.
- Review found external API integrations or credential-adjacent configuration; changes in those areas should receive security-focused review before merge.
- Review found network clients, sockets, web APIs, or service endpoints; changes in those areas should receive security-focused review before merge.
- No primary dependency manifest was detected in the repository root. If dependencies are added later, include a manifest and prefer reproducible installation instructions.

## Service and API Notes

For web services, APIs, sockets, or scraping workflows, prioritize reports involving authentication bypass, authorization errors, injection, server-side request forgery, unsafe deserialization, credential leakage, data exposure, or denial-of-service conditions. Use test accounts and minimal proof-of-concept traffic only.

## Dependency and Supply Chain Security

GitHub Actions validation installs no project dependencies, grants only read
access to repository contents, pins third-party actions by commit, and disables
persisted checkout credentials. The local baseline fails closed when it cannot
inspect tracked secret and editor metadata paths.

Until roadmap scope is defined, issue-template contact routes are limited to
this security policy and `SCOPE.md`; the exact issue-template schema and
reviewed contact copy remain part of the validated boundary.

Dependency updates should come from trusted package managers and should keep lockfiles in sync when lockfiles exist. Do not commit credentials, private keys, tokens, generated secrets, or machine-local configuration. If a vulnerability depends on a compromised package, typosquatting risk, insecure transitive dependency, or unsafe build step, include the package name, affected version, and the path through which it is used.

Hosted validation rejects symlinks, gitlinks, executable-mode drift, unresolved
relative Markdown links, and local links that escape the repository. This keeps
reviewed documentation content tied to ordinary tracked blobs.

The README overview SVG must remain well-formed, self-contained, and inert.
Scripts, foreign HTML, event handlers, linked resources, and CSS `url()`
references are rejected by the documentation gate.

## Safe Research Guidelines

Good-faith research is welcome when it stays within these boundaries:

- use only accounts, devices, data, and infrastructure that you own or have explicit permission to test
- avoid destructive actions, persistence, spam, phishing, social engineering, or denial-of-service testing
- minimize access to personal data and stop testing immediately if private data is exposed
- do not exfiltrate secrets or third-party data; report the minimum evidence needed to verify impact
- keep vulnerability details confidential until the maintainer has assessed the report

## Maintainer Response

The maintainer will review complete reports as availability allows, prioritize issues by exploitability and impact, and coordinate a fix or mitigation when the affected code is still maintained. For sample, archived, or educational repositories, the likely remediation may be documentation, dependency updates, or clearly marking unsupported code rather than a production-style patch release.
